# IMAGE-ENCHANCHER
Overview
The Image Detail Reconstruction project is a specialized image processing tool designed to reconstruct and enhance fine details in images. This project uses techniques in computer vision and deep learning to improve image clarity, refine structural elements, and restore missing or distorted features. The tool aims to deliver high-quality reconstructions suitable for applications where image detail is critical.

Features
Detail Enhancement: Improves the clarity of fine structures in images.
Noise Reduction: Minimizes unwanted noise while preserving important features.
Edge Refinement: Sharpens edges to enhance object boundaries and textures.
Image Restoration: Restores degraded or missing parts of images, useful for old or damaged photos.
Technology Stack
Python: Core programming language.
OpenCV: Used for image processing operations.
TensorFlow & Keras: Employed for deep learning tasks and model training.
Notebook Environment: Project is built and tested in Jupyter Notebook.
